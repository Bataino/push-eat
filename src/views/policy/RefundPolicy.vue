    Cancelation policy
    <br><br>
    By placing an order through our app, you enter into an agreement with PushEat with respect to the processing and
    completion of the order. If you are paying online, PushEat is also responsible for any returns or refunds. However,
    the Chef remains responsible for the preparation, and quality of your order. You agree to take particular care when
    providing us with your details and warrant that these details are accurate and complete at the time of ordering. You
    also warrant that the credit or debit card details that you provide are for your own credit or debit card and that you
    have sufficient funds to make the payment.
    <br><br>
    After order has been confirmed, PushEat reserves all rights to accept cancelation, e.g because preparation of Food has
    been completed and/or delivery personnel has already been dispatched then PushEat shall have a right to charge you
    cancellation fee of ₦500, with a right to make a refund of the order value or recover from your subsequent order, the
    complete/ deficit cancellation fee, as applicable, to compensate our chef and delivery partner.
